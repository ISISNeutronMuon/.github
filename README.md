ISIS Neutron and Muon Source (ISIS) is based at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire and is a world-leading centre for research in the physical and life sciences.

We produce beams of neutrons and muons that allow scientists to study materials at the atomic level using a suite of instruments, often described as ‘super-microscopes’, each of which is individually optimised for the study of different types of matter. Neutron and muon experiments are non-destructive and provide results that cannot be achieved by other techniques. We​ support a national and international community of thousands of scientists doing research in physics, chemistry, materials science, geology, engineering, and biology. Our mission is for neutrons and muons to advance knowledge and improve lives. We do this by working with academia and industry​ to deliver scientific, socio-economic and environmental impact, addressing global challenges and answering fundamental questions.​

​​Software is critical to the operation of ISIS and the experiments ru​n here​. Specialist hardware and software is developed and supported for the community by various ISIS groups often in collaboration with partners in universities and similar international facilities.



ISIS is owned and operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, one of the councils that forms UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).
